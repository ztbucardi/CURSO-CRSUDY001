                          Installing GNU FreeFont
                          =======================

GNU FreeFont can be used in any modern operating system.

This document explains how to install FreeFont on some common systems.

UNIX/GNU/Linux/BSD Systems
--------------------------

FreeFont works with any system using the free font rasterizer FreeType
<http://www.freetype.org/>.

* Debian GNU/Linux

Users of Debian GNU/Linux system will probably want to use the Debian package,
available from the Debian site, 

	<http://packages.debian.org/unstable/x11/ttf-freefont.html>,

or any of its mirrors.

Install them by issuing the command
	apt-get install ttf-freefont


* KDE local installation

Users of KDE can install .ttf files on a per-user basis using the KDE 
Control Center module "kcmfontinst", which may appear in the menu as

	Settings -> System Administration -> Font Installer

This is especially helpful for developers and testers.


* Generic X-windows

	1) Fetch the freefont-ttf.tar.gz package with Free UCS outline fonts
	   in the TrueType format.

	2) Unpack TrueType fonts into a suitable directory,
	   e.g. /usr/local/share/fonts/default/TrueType/

	3) If you have chosen any other directory, make sure the directory you
	   used to install the fonts is listed in the path searched by the X
	   Font Server by editing the config file in /etc/X11/.

	   In some systems, you the directory to the "catalogue=" in the
	   /etc/X11/fs/config.

	4) Run ttmkfdir in the directory where you unpacked the fonts.


Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP; Vista
-------------------------------

Note that in at least Vista, the OpenType versions perform much better than,
and are recommended over, the TrueType ones.

* Vista:
	1) From the Start menu, open Control Panels
	2) Drag-n-drop font files onto Fonts control panel
           You may get a dialog saying
        	"Windows needs your permission to continue"
	   a) Click Continue

* 95/98/NT/2000/XP:
  Probably similar to Vista.


Mac OS X
--------

Installing on Mac OS X consists of moving the .ttf files to either
	/Library/Fonts/  or  ~/Library/Fonts/
depending on whether they should be available to all users on your system
or just to yourself.
